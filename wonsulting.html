              <h4 class="h4 mb-2">My Role / What I Did</h4>
              <p>I was selected from a competitive applicant pool to be part of Wonsulting's first set of interns. I served as a Web Development & Growth Intern between September 2019-March 2020), and I currently still serve as an Ambassador / Mentee. Some of my main tasks and accomplishments are listed below. </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled list-line">
                <li>Migrated website content & information from Weebly to Wix on a newly redesigned site interface, using HTML + CSS to develop new features </li>
                <li>Documented and analyzed social media growth weekly on Instagram & Linkedin, proposing ideas to optimize growth/presence</li>

              <h4 class="h4 mb-2">Ambassador Role</h4>
              <p>As an ambassador, I've helped to host Wonsulting events, and promote workshops & services on campus at my university / online. Additionally, as a first generation, low income college student myself, I've contributed to promoting Wonsulting's underdog-turned-winner mission, through sharing my own personal story and offering mentorship.</p>

              <h4 class="h4 mb-2">Website Migration (Fall 2019)</h4>
              <p>Working closely with the entire executive team and fellow intern, I assisted the lead UX/UI Designer and Web Developer with bringing Wonsulting's newly designed website to life. I helped organize and migrate website content between the old and new site, as the company transitioned from the Weebly CMS to the Wix CMS. Additionally, I used HTML + CSS to help develop various features on the new site. My efforts in helping to rebuild the company website through UX design & strategy increased website clicks and traffic by 43% within the first month of launch. This site has continued to be used and updated by Wonsulting presently. You can visit Wonsulting's current website below.</p>
